# Snake Game

## Purpose

Snake Game is a classic game and when I saw this project, I couldn't help but do it.

It's not a very elaborate project, but it's a lot of fun to play with.

## Overview

To play, just use the arrow keys. The mechanics are the same as the classic snake game, where you have to pick up apples and grow them to their maximum without bumping into anything.

The score is marked and the highscore is saved.

## Run code

To run the code, use:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

So, to close, just click on the X.

## Change of progress

If you want you can delete your highscore just by deleting the data.txt file.
